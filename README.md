Windows Artifact Harvester

This is my CINS 490 Capstone project

I had built this project in order to learn more about Windows Artifact harvesting to be used to help in a digital investigation.

The following information this program grabs is:
1. Chrome history of a user who is logged into chrome
2. Network information of all previous networks with date/time
3. Recently accessed files/ MRU data
4. Every file downloaded on the current logged in account and its exact file location

This taught me a lot about how similarly the Eric Zimmerman tools work as well about different areas within the Windows Registry.

This project is entirely in Python using mostly the Winreg library to parse the registry and Tkinter for a GUI visualization to be shown at the expo
